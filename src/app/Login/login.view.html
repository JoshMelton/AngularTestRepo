<p>module vs component explaination below</p>
<p>this is a component</p>
<p>a component is part of a module, for instance this component is part of the AppModule</p>
<p>all modules are components, but not every component is a module</p>
<p>you maybe wondering what is a module?</p>
<p>a module, is made up of components, it can be made from 1 component, 2 components, 9 components, or more</p>
<p>you could make your entire app, in just the AppModule's html / ts code, but that would lead to a very bloated
  codebase</p>
<p>keep it DRY, (dont repeat yourself), by making modules and reusing them when possible!</p>
<p>reduce reuse recycle!</p>
